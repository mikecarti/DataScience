# Dependencies for linux:
Use python3.10

```bash
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
spacy download en_core_web_sm
python main.py
```

If does not work:
```bash
pip install -q -U bitsandbytes
pip install -q -U git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git 
pip install -q -U git+https://github.com/huggingface/peft.git
pip install -q -U git+https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate.git
python main.py
```

# Process
### Research
Searched for good embeddings, that would fit on my 4GB GPU, 
decided to stop on intfloat/e5-base, as it is lightweight and pretty good, compared to alternatives.

### Ideas for similar phrase detection
First of all, I thought of all ideas, that could work for a text
improvement engine. It was obvious, that I need to work with word representations,
but it was not obvious, how to capture phrases. First idea was to just split
sentences by words, and analyze word by word, but single word is not able to 
capture phrase complexity, then there was another extreme: feed whole sentence into
similarity search. In latter case, we may encounter problems such as:
1) Long sentences vector representations contain too much noise with respect to business phrases
2) We may encounter several phrases, and we will not be able to suggest the exact way of replacing these phrases.


Thus the new idea was born: to find a way of splitting a sentence by its phrases. After 2 hours
of research, i decided to stop on a solution with benepar library.

### Similarity measure
```math
\begin{align}
S(a,b) = \text{cosSim}(a, b) * \Big( \frac{log(\text{wordCount(a)})}{log(\text{MaxDocWordCount})} \Big)^\alpha
\end{align}
```

For similarity measure I took simple cosine_similarity multiplied and normalized 
with natural logarithm of word count to fight short phrase scoring problem. $\alpha$ is a hyper-parameter,
describing how much score is supposedly affected by word count.

### Stack
I decided to use FAISS vector database, as it is convinient
to store vector representations there. For task of sentence splitting (i.e split a sentence
by phrases), I researched a lot of options, but as this field is 
not very popular (sentence segmentation) I decided to go with average, good-enough for 4 hours task tool library - benepar.
Model loading and inference is done through nltk and huggingface.

### Text Improvement
I decided to not stop with suggesting phrases, but also added contextualisation,
given a large enough LLM, programm will suggest not only which words to change, but
how to change them as well.

### Future Improvements
- Better Embeddings (e5 Mistral 7B)
- Better LLM (LLAMA 2)
- Tune hyper-parameters (LLM hyper-parameters, norm_scaling_factor, similarity threshold)
- Hyper Parameters may be tuned with use of collecting dataset for a classification task and Grid Search
- Find a better function for similarity measure
- Try to add business-like vectors to analyzed vectorized phrases with context-smart attention mechanism
- Fine-tune model for this specific task
- Train a model for sentence segmentation task

### Results
Specific preloaded phrases are located in the file standard_phrases.txt. Sample text for
analysis is located in text.txt. All scores were obtained with e5_base embeddings.
