Classic ML practice on Evgeny's Sokolov course for Machine Learning. All code written by me, code includes complicated topics with implementing some of classic ML algorithms and data processing algorithms. 

Practice is splitted into 6 parts.
- Pandas
- Linear Regression
- Gradient Descent (gd)
- Linear Classification (lin_class)
- Decision Trees (trees)
- Gradient Boosting Methods (boosting)
